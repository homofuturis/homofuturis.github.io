Though I don't write, but looking at the serious measures taken by the World Governments I decide to clarify some things as we go about a global lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

> In 2018, there were an estimated 405 000 deaths from malaria globally, compared with 416 000 estimated deaths in 2017, and 585 000 in 2010.
