Though I don't write, but looking at the serious measures taken by the World Governments I decide to clarify some things as we go about a global lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic.


To start off, I would like to show some stats regarding other diseases that are highly prevalent in world apart from COVID-19.

* Malaria
> In 2018, there were an estimated 405,000 deaths from malaria globally, compared with 416,000 estimated deaths in 2017, and 585,000 in 2010.
