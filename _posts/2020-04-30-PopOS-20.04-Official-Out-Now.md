The company further says, "Another main improvement for Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS is the integration of Flatpak support in the Pop!_Shop. Now when you download an application, you have the option to pull packages from the curated Pop!_OS repository, Flathub, or Ubuntu repositories. Flathub expands our software library and the number of applications available to you. Furthermore, applications packaged through Flatpak have significant privacy advantages, as these applications are limited in their access to only what the application requires to function."
