### Competition to the Google Chrome
Apple has launched privay feature for its Safari Browser which blocks all third party cookies to be stored on the device. This is currently for all iPhones.

### Why is this Important?
As you may think, browsers are not so simple piece of software. Ofcourse they let use the internet, but that is not all they do. Browsers have all the information about what websites you visit. It can store cookies, sessions, and it can share those information with other party (some which you are not actually visiting website).

For now, this is a very good step forward in terms of the users' privacy online. As world has seen increasing privacy infringements, Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, Google's operations in its services from Gmail to Android. 

A detailed structure post of how web browsers track you and your behaviour online will be available soon.
