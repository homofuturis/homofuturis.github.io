Though I don't write, but looking at the serious measures taken by the World Governments I decided to clarify some things as we go about the only global lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

To start off, I would like to show some stats regarding other diseases that are highly prevalent in world apart from COVID-19.

* Malaria
> In 2018, there were an estimated 405,000 deaths from malaria globally, compared with 416,000 estimated deaths in 2017, and 585,000 in 2010.

* Cancer

* Heart Disease
> About 647,000 Americans die from heart disease each year - that's 1 in every 4 deaths.

Above we see the mortality being very high in number. Now, we take a look at COVID-19 death toll by Johns Hopkins University.

* COVID-19
> As of April 23rd, 2020 (Updated) the death toll has risen to 184,268 deaths.

You can easily deduced from above that the COVID-19 is not as deadly as your conventional media portrays it. This does not completes it we have various more evidence that can calm your nerves about this COVID-19 Pandemic(hoax).
