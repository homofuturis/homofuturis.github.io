check one check two is the gravy ready to go check one check two hello hello hi everybody okay bebe has to give sidekick bear CPR real quick yes my my cocaine-addicted bear just had a massive heart attack and I had to where is he I just had to revive him fortunately dr. Kaufman is about to get on the line this is episode 8:07 dr. Kaufman and I discussed turpentine viruses and the broken medical system I am going to call him up now and get him on the line um and of course as you can see I'm wearing my medical jacket because a man of science can identify another man of science yeah one second I'm making sure he's ready yeah one second let me call dr. cotton Han sorry about the stutter step in the beginning I just want to have a nice clean interview and not just me rambling about winks from God for like 20 minutes I'll talk about all that tomorrow tomorrow the same time 9:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time I have an unbelievable story to tell you guys and until then we will call dr. Kaufman and learn about turpentine viruses and what not here we go your name's Frank what are we rocking yeah all right all right linear me how are ya all right how are you Owen good do revive it's an honor to talk to your brother and because I know you are an accredited medical doctor I dressed for the part because I want you to know that I'm also I'm also a man of science oh man I wouldn't got my stethoscope out I I don't think you're telling the truth unless you have a stethoscope and a grant from Bill Gates dude I just want to tell you man I as somebody who's fought a beast out of Hollywood I know what it I can't even imagine what it would be like to go against the medical mainstream so I've a I'm coming in this thing with a lot of respect for you my friend so uh I want you to explain to us the benefits of turpentine viruses and we have to talk about Cox for those of you things for those my favorite subject for those you that don't know there's something called the Cox postulate only men of science like us know what that is but he'll get to that all right man how are you I'm doing great I've never been tired oh you've been going hard out here I have yes awesome man well uh first off will you tell the people that turpentine is good for you uh yeah it certainly can be in the right amount on the right way absolutely please illuminate the people thank you yeah well so you know I wouldn't talk about this unless I've done it myself because I don't you know ever talk to people about about stuff that I haven't experimented with so I know for sure you know what how it works what it's good for and such but I learned about turpentine from dr. Jennifer Daniels and at first and I've done a lot of my own research and experimented and I think it's one of the most powerful detoxification agents that's out there and I know a lot of people think that it might like kill parasites or that kind of thing but I don't I don't really think it works that way I think it works for its solvent properties because everything in our body you know is aqueous means it's like water-based right I mean our body's like 60 or 70 percent water or something like that right yes yeah yeah make sure you drink enough yeah one one cord for sixty pound body way today so so there's like some sludge I think that gets stuck in our bodies from various sources and the water just can't get at it for whatever reason and I think this is the stuff that the parasitic organisms really like they they like you know splash around in the slop and maybe eating it and such so they hang around and sometimes cause problems when too much of it builds up so I think that the turpentine just dissolves it away and then you know once once the home is gone and then you know all the parasites or whatever that were hanging around they they've got no reason to hang around anymore so they just go and you know the first time I did this myself actually had worms in the toilet that I could see whoa yes they weren't moving around never done yeah and didn't it used to be a known medical thing that that it had to be almost propagandized away like wasn't that it wasn't that in medical journals that it was a medicine of sorts yeah absolutely so the Merck Manual is the biggest thing like I don't know if you heard of the Merck Manual but it's like made by merck pharmaceutical that huge you know a conglomerate yeah and they've been around for a while so they they have this book you know comes out like every year and it has every therapy Utica agent that's known and sometime you know after the Rockefeller and the Exeter report it's switched over to only having pharmaceutical medications in there but if you look at older virgin versions of it like the knight 1898 one it has turpentine like as a treatment for over 60 different illnesses and including being like one of the primary treatments for syphilis walleye and many other conditions yeah that's so yeah it's it's really awesome so there's also like some literature from France and then you know dr. Daniels tells the story about back in the time of African slaves in our country that they used this as a medicine because it was something they could make it was very cheap it's just you know distilled pine sap basically and when the slave master or someone in their family was really sick and you know nothing was getting the better they would supposedly go to the slaves and asked for the turpentine Wow yeah they I've read up on that there's this one at UM african-american professor who actually was reporting about house a lot of slaves would live longer than their masters because they had a better diet that worked outside and they were and he was studying this and of course he got fired from his university because that was because god forbid someone talks about how you know a lot of times the masters just like in on in the book by Tolstoy confession over there that were just called serfs but it was a similar relationship where they would seek out the serfs to get medical treatment because they're heiress aristocratic cosmopolitan lifestyle they were they were dying 20 30 years before the the slaves because the slaves were actually eating raw food being outside all this stuff it's pretty fascinating yeah well I mean even I like in old times like the Royals who would you know experience gluttony because of their resources but you know like Henry the eighth is most famous for this but they had terrible health you know they were dying young because of that that you know rich living and it was really like the the Industrial Revolution that kind of changed things for us and you know food became manufactured in a factory and you know industrial chemicals were used and permeate you know our environment pretty much air water and soil so that's that's really had a bad effect and you know so we need turpentine now more than ever and the fact that they made it illegal you know the the FDA I think somewhere in the 40s they they decided to ban it from any medicinal products but there's one exception I don't know if you know about this but there's one product still on the market that has turpentine but they have to kind of hide it because they they got grandfathered in and so it's it's on the outer box you could see it listed as an inactive ingredient but on the tub itself it's not on the label at all and the product is vicks vapor rub Wow yeah cuz they would do well with that I can see that yeah so if you like let's say you can experiment with this because this is totally you know not like taking turpentine internally but just like you know next time you have a mosquito bite or your kid has a mosquito bite put some just a dab of fix on there and then look at it in a three or four hours later and you'll see it's completely gone what is the mechanism because I'm seeing this now I used to feel more oppressed by the elites what is the mechanism to make them because they no longer do I what's the Meccan I really don't know we made a lockdown hasn't affected you nah I've been in quarantine for years my friend I have a homestead my I would eat what are you gonna spread I like when when everybody was stocking up on toilet paper I was like quick cover crop seeds you know I'm just not in that world at all but uh ask you some leaves is that it well yeah I mean I just we make our all our friends are cool you know we have playdates here we have some acreage some goats chickens alpacas green you know I saw this coming years ago because I was a Hollywood comedian that had been in and on television shows and all this and because of my opposition of trans children transform owns with children I got banned from every comedy club and I might they had my picture on the wall you know oh yeah it was it was fascinating and so it sucked but I experienced my economic collapse years ago and so I'm here as a time traveler to tell everybody everything will be fine they're burning away stuff you don't need and always remember everything requires consent everything I know dudes that don't have social security numbers so it's like your everything will be okay as long as you understand what you may have to go without and that's pretty much just convenience and approval from horrible people you know what why don't you tell the people your story how did how did you become somebody who could actually talk about viruses and what's your background and how did this all happen yeah well I mean I have somewhat of a pretty traditional medical background you know I went to MIT as an undergrad I worked in public health for a little while actually reported AIDS cases for the first CDC position in New York City and then I went to PA school and I worked in cancer medicine for two years like with really really sick people like with acute leukemia and people like that yeah then I went to medical school in South Carolina and then I decided to specialize in psychiatry and I did that training at Duke and then sub specialize in forensic psychiatry which is like being an expert witness more or less maybe working in that correctional setting and as I was a you know practicing psychiatry I just realized that these drugs that were supposed to prescribe to everybody they don't really do anything good yeah you know there's some rare exceptions but there's they're rare so you saying AZT that isn't isn't the education best friend well you know there's a drug in Psych that's like gays et because AZT was like put on the shelf because it was too toxic I think it was developed as a cancer drug and so there's a drug in psychiatry like that it's called clozapine and it was like way too toxic to use and then somehow they got the idea that it might help people with schizophrenia and you know they told me that actually this is like the miracle drug that like it would turn someone with schizophrenia into a regular person again right yeah and but I was too afraid I was too afraid to use it because it causes like the same thing as chemo like we're white count is low and you can get bad infections and then it could cause like sudden cardiac death and heart failure and all these really nasty things so but then I saw people later on in my practice like several people who are on at some of them I had to like take over prescribing for a period of time and I didn't see anybody have any miracle not a you know not once but I did see people get really sick from it yeah and I saw people gain a ton of weight and be drooling and like their whole shirt was all all soaking wet I mean imagine walking around like that every day as an adult what does he got a page like torture what yeah what did you what did you see at the cancer places like was there the cancer treatments is not working no well they basically destroyed a person's immune system and other parts of their body and then they would get really really sick and then recover and then the cancer may not be as strong right after their they recover but then it would just come back in you know a couple of weeks couple months you know maybe six months at the most for some of the less aggressive diseases like multiple myeloma yeah and you know nobody was cured from chemotherapy at all everyone died eventually there were there's a couple of rare forms of cancer that have like a biologic treatment like there's this one kind of leukemia that's called promyelocytic leukemia and you actually treat it with this like high dose vitamin A preparation because there's like some gene mutation and vitamin A metabolism and so people got were practically cured from that I mean they went into full remissions and went back to a normal life but that wasn't with the Kotaku chemo that was with retinoic acid you know vitamin a derivative yep but you can't patent that and use it against people well you know see that's the thing they couldn't just give you like carrots or liver like like I would would do now yeah they had they had to make like a special pharmaceutical version of it it was called atra or all-trans-retinoic acid but you know I always wondered was that really necessary because or was it just more profitable than you know a regular old vitamin a pill what's the best thing someone with cancer should do or someone to avoid cancer because they're just a cuz I heard you talking to crow about how diabetes diabetes type 2 can be cured with diet completely and that's just behind what's the best way to deal with cancer you think well you know Kemp there's not quite as simple because and but it's totally misunderstood like cancer is actually your body's mechanism of trying to save you from death because you build up too much toxic crap basically and the cancer is a way to contain it but unfortunately like if if you don't do anything about it it'll get overwhelmed and then you know spread around your body like it can't contain it forever yeah so the earlier that you make changes to your lifestyle the better off you are and you definitely I mean if you pay attention to what you're putting in your body and on your body you can you know massively reduce the risk of cancer yeah cuz doesn't sunblock have heavy metals in it that cause skin cancer well there's some interesting studies that show that like you know cuz it used to be thought or it was told to me like in my medical training that if you get bad sunburns as a kid that increases your chance of getting melanoma which is the bad skin cancer that could kill you yeah as an adult and I went back and looked at some of those studies after I started you know seeing things differently and studying different types of medicine and what I found is that it's actually the sunscreen it's much more likely that causes the cancer to occur later on not the sunburns did cancer the cancer exists before the nineteen hundred's very often or now well you know people there were many things that didn't exist back then and the same in the same ways you know like one really interesting thing has to do with our teeth like back then people there they had room for their wisdom teeth like they didn't get them out there's no like ancient wisdom teeth extraction surgeries so it's like many people had bigger jaws and Weston a price was the the first one he was like a dentist or a forensic odontologist and he went around and studied like the fossil record and interviewed people in indigenous cultures and such and you know found that after then we started making food and factories that we were started missing certain nutrients that allowed the bone growth to develop fully that's amazing I never even thought of that like what did they do before people ripped out your wisdom teeth Wow people had straight teeth too because most of the crooked teeth is because there's not enough room in your jaw for all your teeth and so they get crowded together and that's why I like they always want to pull kids teeth to get me straight teeth whoa what what is the nutrient that people are missing well so there there are three nutrients according to Western prices study its vitamin A vitamin D and vitamin k2 and k2 is kind of a key one because it's normally in meat if the meat is raised on its natural food like ruminants like cows that eat grass in grass there's vitamin k1 which is like the vitamin K shot that they want to give to babies right after they're born that's for blood clotting but vitamin k2 is a totally different vitamin it has to do with that your your mineral regulation and your bones and such like you know putting calcium and phosphate in there or taking it out like bone remodeling and so when the cow eats the grass they convert that k1 in the grass to k2 and then you eat that meat you get the k2 but if they eat like corn and soy you know feed then there's no k1 in there so there's no k2 in the meat fascinating yeah yeah and we have some of the best grass in Washington um it's the our Ortega what kind of grass the grass that we grow for our animals here the orchard grass is like unique to the world there they ship it all over the world because the high I believe the vitamin K in it so that's that's really interesting really yeah Wow that it's cool yeah because the cows use the vitamin k2 like that they make their own and they stay use it too it's like they don't just make it so we get in their meat is it uh is it also in chicken like that or is it just red meat I think I think it is but I you know don't quote me on that for sure but it's also you can get vitamin k2 and fermented vegetables yeah especially like natto has a really high concentration it's supposedly it smells you know awful like they have a special room in restaurants for people to eat that in China it's some kind of fermented soy product because if your recommendation actually got that uh Himalayan minerals black goo stuff oh she legit yeah yeah I dig it yeah you do yeah how do you like the taste of it I don't mind it it tastes tastes earthy but I when you were talking about the minerals that you're missing I was like I really want to get involved in that because you know that's what we're doing here we have raw goat milk and um we grow our food and stuff and have a well pump and we're trying to do the best we can to get Babylon out of our system you know my wife and I used to live in Atlanta I was there 16 years Road comedian you know tedious lifestyle so but we're seeing a lot of good stuff like our kids I'm very tall but our kids are definitely in the high brackets of height which I saw a decline in out there because I think nutrition so you know she breastfed for a while for all them and you know we're really trying to reconnect to our own health once we realized how broken that the medical system was which is what I'd love to talk to you about about even just the nature of a virus I think this Kovan 19 thing is doing a service it's almost like Caitlyn Jenner where it's it's so when Caitlyn Jenner was a woman of the year I think about about 10 million pupils just went wide and could see things they could never see before uh-huh I think that's happening with these face masks and and I would love for you to ladle the gravy as we say here and let the people know what a virus is how its spread and what do you think and this one we can talk about the Cox postulate was checking out your video from earlier just educate the people my friend yeah well what I really think is that when you know that they had this idea that there was some unseen like small germ of some kind that was causing the diseases that they couldn't explain at the time right like polio myelitis is one of those diseases and but since they had this like idea that they knew it was a virus and they knew was some tiny thing they called it a virus even before they ever saw a particle that when they first you know saw through the electron microscope which was a new technology they saw the particle and they're like there it is there's the virus that's causing all these diseases and they didn't say well look they're tiny particles I wonder what they are right and so they never investigated what they are right they just assumed they're causing disease but they actually couldn't meet the criteria to prove that which is Koch's postulates but later on only thirty years ago now because viruses were discovered in the 1930s I believe and or the particles but then about 30 years ago like in the 80s or it's the 90s they discovered exosomes and exosomes look just like viruses under the microscope and they have the same structure and they have genetic material all the varieties that they said viruses had but they come from our own cells and ourselves every kind of cell in our body every cell in every mammal all produce these and they're producing them all the time but if certain things happen like they get exposed to a toxin like antibiotics or heavy metals or ionizing radiation or they have like psychological stress like pretty much anything that would make you sick our bodies start putting out more or more exosomes right so what I think really happened is that all along when they discovered these particles they were always exosomes but they they never looked at the possibility that they could come from our own bodies but but the the biologists had some thoughts about this because in that talk I mentioned this this guy rivers and this he wrote this paper in 1937 where he modified Koch's postulates to specifically be for viruses and in this paper he wrote two things he wrote that virus basically that there's uncertainty about what viruses really are and he said that they're highly associated with the host cells which would basically be our cells right and that they could represent he is this term like auto catalytic processes but what he was referring to I think is programmed cell death which we now call a pitocin was discovered much later but it's basically what a cell is too old or something's wrong with it and it just undergoes like auto destruct sequence right so it's different than what like some toxin comes in and fries too so that's called necrosis but this at mitosis is programmed thing it forms these gloves and they're tiny little vesicles that look just like exosomes they contain different things in exosomes but they look you know also like the way viruses look because viruses and exosomes look the same so so even in 1937 this prominent biologist was basically saying you know they could be our own parts of our own body we're not really sure her that up and that idea never really got explored in research because all guy wasn't he liked to wait I just killed my son with this weird experiment oh you talk about Jenner yeah yeah yeah that guy was nuts too like he's that you know the first one to invent the vaccine I think basically it's called vaccine because of cow pox which was back Sandia so it comes from you know the the root for cow all right which is related to cattle and chattel interestingly and oh because we get vaccines like like where the cattle right and her herd immunity fits in with that linguistic paradigm but yeah he basically just took the pus out of cow pox lesions from sick cows and then you know sliced oat made a small slice in your skin and put the pus right I mean what a bad idea and so he did you did this to his son was one of the first people and his son and it up like crippled yeah no and then they didn't how much of this is just blind hubris where it's like we see something we have a theory run with it inject everyone and how much of it is nefarious psychopathy like how much of this is just human errors where no one will admit they were wrong until it just snowballs into complete psychosis or how much is like we're gonna get everyone sick you know yeah yeah well you know it's hard to tell but you know a lot of people at least hundreds of thousands died from Jenner's work yeah of course it wasn't recorded that way in the history books but if you go to like the you know the Royal Academy of Sciences archives you can you can find the statistics of how many people died way more than died of smallpox died after they were receiving this so-called vaccination but you know if you want to talk about sort of nefarious intent I think you should mention Louis Pasteur because he was a guy that didn't really have an original idea in his career and he got all the credit for germ theory and basically he was just hobnobbing around the aristocracy and and the the government and he would steal ideas from other scientists like antoine de chillon who was like a serious scientist he just wanted to figure out what's going on and then pastor would like misinterpret the experiments or he would conduct them in a like sensationalist way like he did this one where he took word around so all the vineyards like in wine country in southern france and collected air samples to do his repeat basically beige owns fermentation experiment you know but it but he had reporters and you know there every time he visited a vineyard and he would do this thing where he put the air in the bottle i know it's just showmanship it's like edison that's an Edison off the back of Tesla Tesla was like I just discovered something beautiful I like electrocute an elephant what he's like show the people pain yeah no I these people are littered throughout our history where you have a genius and you have people actually doing stuff and then they they skim the top they steal it and then they they they're usually very good at marketing like the Bernays type where then they just shove it out with these this brilliant wizardry to get everyone to poison themselves you know Oh totally it's and I would stay but - meows - I was listening to you and James trues I love James true he's become a good buddy of mine your discussion of germ theory versus terrain theory and it dawned on me I was always buddies with this dude Jesse Spencer who played dr. chase on the show dr. house if you've ever seen it and it dawned on me the whole thing's terrain theory so you have dr. house which is backwards for a house doctor and he's always sending everyone to break into their house to see what toxins are there and what they're eating and that's how he cracks the code and they parallel in no way yeah it was like the most it was the biggest show for like 15 years or 12 years and it's this hour-long show and you have this like madman dr. house played by a Hugh Laurie and he only focuses on terrain theory no it's never germ like this one episode this male porn star was constantly getting sick and there's the tree started it turned out is because his mother never let him play in dirt he was never exposed to dirt growing up it was one of these ironies you know and then they would it was always about it was like find his cat test his cat you know what is there a radon bah-bah-bah and then if you go to an actual medical practice it's your body's the problem nuke it with poison and I'm like what is that psychologically about people that we're almost drawn to the truth of terrain theory because we're living in this germ theory madness I think germ theory is almost just based on how people hated Germans because it was the 30s you know people like German germ look I don't know what motivates people but watching the Cova 19 thing is pure madness and what do you what do you what do you see going on right now give us some more gravy well yeah definitely I mean first of all like the the Germany thing was always weird because you know they call it Deutschland sorry why don't we get how do we get Germany from that but but germ actually the the root of germ means a bud or a new growth so like in biology the germ cells is like the sperm and the egg Germany right yeah it's what makes a new life right so it's sort of weird to like then invert the meaning to something that you know invades your body and causes disease so you know that that pattern is so common right like everything's inverted it's the same thing with turpentine right they say it's poison when actually it's medicine yeah right dude it's everywhere I mean the sunblock causes skin cancer the bank is destroying your dower the school is teaching your kids sodomy it's like the whole world is flipped you know it's kind of like you know freedom is slavery slavery is freedom you know it's like feminism has become a 40 role with no family working to pay off an unpayable debt it's like what is that you know and I wonder how much of this we're doing to ourselves cuz I try to always think who is this day everyone keeps speaking of like is Bill Gates just a random weirdo that somehow has been drawn into the National the global consciousness because somehow people want to wear masks out of shame does that sound like a theory that could roll I just don't understand it no well you know all these guys I mean I don't think they're they're the ones in charge like Bill Gates oh you know I think he's born more like a spokesperson right but but just look at all these people who are up there you know like I just saw a thing that foul Chee is was on the board of the building Linda Gates found eight or the Clinton Foundation sorry they're like 10 years right and then they're connected to gates as well so it's like you know there's like this Club right well I mean you know it's more than that I'm sure they're involved in some sadistic rituals yeah but but you know they're all connected and they're all they're all playing the game whatever it is you know and we're just here to sit and wait for the next move or you know or be just sheep no more like vodkas yeah yeah so what do you recommend for people to deal with all this stuff like what is the best way to handle a medical world that because there is good Pete you know there is good people in medicine there's people trying to save lives in medicine they just have a few fundamental groundwork logical problems happening what what do you think's the best thing people can do to protect themselves and their families moving forward with all this yeah well I I think actually staying away from the healthcare system because even though there there are good you know well-meaning people there are lots of them right it's the majority like there's not too many people that just you know sit around and say how can I make money off these folks but there are those people - for sure but but the thing is it's like what they're they don't really have autonomy over what what they do they have to follow the standard of care to keep their license right which is this is all this risk I'm taking right I mean I can talk about these things but I can't you know I can't have a doctor-patient relationship with someone and recommend turpentine because that would I would lose my license very quickly right because of not following the standard of care so every doctor has to do that otherwise they'll they'll be punished or they'll be sued and so they really have no choice if they're gonna continue make to you know work in that career and they have to do it and if you go to the hospital or the doctor's office you're basically be agreeing to be part of that right and and they're gonna pressure you to do things that you don't want and you're gonna be in a very uncomfortable situation like you know bad you go in there with the laceration and you want to get some stitches boy they are gonna hound you to take a tetanus vaccine you know they're not and even sometimes they just do it without even asking like my buddy was telling me about this when he had a baby and he you know instructed them and he had it in the hospital right and instructed them he's like I don't want any injections for this child and then he turned his back for one second and there's a nurse sticking him with an injection yeah they're obsessed with it because it's backwards it's because it must be right because if not they'd be wrong you know yeah well you know I mean what's the license right you mentioned some some law stuff before right what really is a license it is permission you know from the government to do something that's illegal if you if you jab someone with a needle that's assault right right unless you have a license to do some so and then you could do it legally Wow so but isn't that just gonna water down the value of the license it's almost like back in the day it's like oh you're gonna be you're gonna have your myspace account delete it you know it's like it wanted a certain tipping point it became like I don't care you know it's kind of like now I know how to tour without comedy clubs I can do airplane hangars any space you can just set up a an audio setup and I could actually make more money than I did before I'm starting to realize that a lot of these licensing type scams you can make a better living a more honest living a healthier living if you don't comply with them because they don't they can't control you they can just get you to submit you know well I think you know that may be generally true and there's certainly a lot of ways to make a living but you know with doctors they they put you through this long training and there's all this delayed gratification and big student loan debt you know I think something like two hundred thousand dollars is the average student loan debt yeah when I got out of my training I basically had a mortgage payment in student loan debt you know before I had a house and so then then you know you finally get to the point where you're making some real money and you buy a house you know you buy a car you know you get here your wife gift if you're a guy and and then you you build up more debt and so you have to keep working to pay that off and if you want to get out like there's not an immediately obvious way for doctors to make a living out of the system because everybody is you know uses the system there are very few people that are outside of it I mean I hope that's growing now because I'm trying to build a consultation practice using that killing methods and you know when people do that they they're cured from diseases that the the regular system says they're gonna suffer for the rest of their life from Oh go to you over a doctor if I if I had a giant lump I'd be like here's a bar of gold cure me like people don't trust the shit anymore like once you realize what if that vaccine has fetus cells like can you tell the people what's in a vaccine oh my gosh well there's the things that are reported in there and then there's the things that are in there that are not reported but there's preservatives like some contain mercury things like polysorbate 80 or in there there is aluminum hydroxide is the big thing that's that I think the most toxic thing that's in almost every vaccine and basically the reason it's there is because it gives such a shock to your immune system that it makes a lot more antibodies because it's so toxic so that that's in there and that causes most of the disease I think from vaccines but there's also DNA in there so like there's different DNA's even from some of it is from an aborted fetus yeah at the back people won't allow themselves to believe it but that's a fact yeah like the diseases I mean I find like testimony in front of Congress where the doctor who is doing that research tells that that's in there so it's totally verifiable it's not it's not some wives tale it's really there yeah and so when do the diseases kick in like let's say you get vaccinated as a baby it is is the response that year or like 40 years later do you get something how does that work well you know it's interesting because it could happen either way and Forest Moretti is a guy I'd definitely recommend people check out because he's written four books on basically related to vaccines that one is called crooked the real cause of manmade disease and I definitely start with that one but he's looked at the history and the science related to vaccine induced morbidities and going back you know well into the early 1800s and so what he talked about is really fascinating that when you have like an acute injury or an acute illness your immune system responds to the site of the injury but it also responds to your brain and it's like a backup thing like you know me cuz it needs some input from the brain to coordinate things or something like that so it always goes up there and you know when I was in medical school they taught us that there's no lymphatic system in the brain and the lymphatic is that the blood there they're like a third set of blood vessels that our immune system uses to travel around our body and they only discovered that it exists in the brain in like the early 2000s so that's the way that the immune system can respond up there and it turns out it goes right by the cranial nerve nuclei and those are the nerves that control like all of the functions of your head and neck and then some other ones like your vagus nerve which which controls digestion and some other things and so basically if you have a situation where it's like a kid that's been vaccinated before and I have to they don't like it and they have to go in and get like three or four needles and it's like they're screaming and moving around and like the mom and the nurse are like holding them down and jabbing them in the thighs that that is causing trauma right there from the injections so in that case what they're gonna do is they're gonna have that response right away and they're gonna take that aluminum from the injection and bring it right to the brain right then and that's when you can see like basically the next day the kid is not the same in some way and it could be subtle where they have like a crooked face like that one side of their smile is turned down or their eyes are uneven in some way it could have manifest a lot of other different ways with the cranial nerves but they also may have you know like just you know like be autistic in a day or have some other neurologic problem like that yeah if they get the injection and it's not a traumatic thing in and of itself then what your body does is it walls it off right in the skin under the injection site and something called a granuloma and that's a protective measure because your body like we didn't you know whether you believe in evolution or design like we weren't built with metals like aluminum in our environment that only came from like mining and Industry yeah right so there's a some arsenic in this soil and maybe we could deal with that a little better but but you know the body like when it gets in your body like the immune system says gosh we don't really know what the heck to do with this let's just keep it Waldorf so we'll you know mess anything up and those granulomas can stay there for years and years and then there could be some other event that basically causes them to get disrupted and then they could be piggybacked on the immune cells to a different part of your body like responding to something and like this can happen during pregnancy a lot because a lot of times after during pregnancy is when someone will get like rheumatoid arthritis for example yeah and that has to do with the joints relaxing to allow the pelvis to expand for the delivery and it maybe brings your immune system to the joints and it piggybacks the aluminum there and then causes issues is there let's say somebody is VAX are vaccines injured is there ways to heal is there ways to get past it to detox well I'm glad you mentioned that because that's actually my number one priority doing this kind of consulting work yes that I'm trying to develop a protocol to do just that it's not an easy thing to do like even in the mainstream medicine they have like you know IV chelation and there's some like doctors like dr. Betar who is very outspoken now about kovat and you know it's a good guy I think he does IV chelation with this and you know there's some success but but it's a it's a difficult thing it's a long thing they're going down route there's some risks of damaging the kidneys and other problems so I'm trying to use natural means but there you know some very potent medical medicines out there that can that can help with this and you know turpentine is one of them how people definitely had success with turpentine and with Miracle medical miracle mineral solution mms you know ethylene oxide yeah so you know but there's other things like you know I'm very interested in spirits yeah you know anything about that a little bit uh yeah go on it's that was the medicinal of alchemy yeah so like the principle is that you you know you have something natural and you break it down into its component parts and you purify those components and then you recombine it into something new so you take you know plant and into its component parts which is like the the spirit the mercury and assault which is like the liquid and the body and the Spirit is the alcohol and you can then recombine them once you purify those elements into like let's say a tincture would be the simplest to us but Jarek preparation and it could be very potent as a medicine and it will enhance the medicinal effects of that plant rather than just taking it you know raw or dried which which is often you know good enough for many things so like that's one thing that I I'm very hopeful that's gonna be effective but there's you know other things like that that are basically natural ki laters or sometimes they called binding agents like zeolite and bentonite clay diatomaceous earth and a few others and so those things could be useful but it's one challenges that you can get those things in the gut but you can't get them in the blood and so if you want to suck the metals out of like the tissues you can't do that directly through the gut so you need some other way to liberate them and one of the things that's really effective is actually the she legit because what your body does is like it uses all these metals like they call them trace minerals but they're really metals but they're not the toxic metals their metal center body needs and they act like cofactors and with different proteins like some of them for enzymes or they change the shape like just like iron in hemoglobin like the iron binds the oxygen right and you know we need iron in our diet and it's a metal so all these other metals do similar things with other proteins in your body but when you're deficient in them the body kind of makes do with what's available so if you have some lead hanging around or some mercury or some aluminum it might substitute for the metal and it desires in the protein so it can function maybe not as optimally but it can still function so when you're the trace minerals what happens is they're more thermodynamically favored so they pop in there and displace all the toxic ones and so that frees up the toxic ones to get in the blood and then if you you know have good detox routes open you can hopefully get them out of your body completely do some people not get affected by vaccines do some people just flush it when they get shocked as my kids I used to trust everyone in the lab coat and was in crippling debt so okay so my kids got vaccines but they seem healthy is is do some people just flush it or is it always in there well you know some people definitely you know do not really get affected by this and you know I can't tell you the individual factors but it could have to do with you know their lifestyle or even simple things like how often you know they use the bathroom at the time you know they're getting the shots so people are resilient yeah of course but but it it can actually hang around in your body and cause disease much later and then and then also like there could be very subtle signs that you wouldn't pick up on like there was this doctor Andrew Malden and he was a pioneer in this he was one of the first people to recognize these very subtle cranial nerve injuries that would cause like slight crookedness in various facial features and he actually developed a way of like looking at photographs and using a computer to measure these very subtle asymmetries and he could basically detect like when you had a subtle injury that you even he couldn't see just observing you with his eyes even though he's very skilled and he would do this thing where like if you let's say you got ill later in life and you had baby pictures or child pictures from like before and after vaccine he could do this analysis on those photographs and show that the injury occurred from the vaccine even though it might have been 20 or 30 years ago and I think this really scared some people high up because he kind of suddenly died in the prime of his life after being very healthy yeah in the midst of this yeah do you think that so yeah that people that reveal this stuff big some weird Hillary Clinton West oh yeah well you know there's a if you go and search like for natural healers who mysteriously died you can find quite a long list and you know I have I have personal knowledge of one of these people I won't say their name but they were basically curing people of cancer and they got a phone call saying basically telling them that if you don't stop doing this we're gonna kill you and about a year later this person just had a sudden heart attack even though they were healthy and you know that the CIA has this heart attack gun and this is all so you could see congressional testimony describing it from like the 80s and it basically is some kind of micro dart that has you know some kind of toxin that stops your heart and but it's so small that it can't really be detected unless you know exactly what you're looking for yeah that's interesting man I yeah it's so crazy that there's that many people that are in the business of keeping people sick but I mean it just it runs its course though it's like it's getting to the point of madness every criminal enterprise enters the madness clown world Ponzi scheme section and I think we're seeing that right now where people are like what you know what's your threshold a hundred vaccines 200 you know how many kisum every kid has autism like when does it end you know yeah well there are some people who have speculated actually that they would want everyone to be mildly autistic yeah yeah they make great eye soldiers yeah perhaps or you could just direct their activities in one narrow area and they wouldn't you know be bored because like one of the things that can happen with autism is they they kind of get obsessive about a certain subject that they're interested in uh they are not interested in anything else besides that subject and that that could be useful for you know for a worker or a dead slave to be that way totally that's whatever you get it just right it's all about yeah I know they're trying to fine-tune it it's all I think it's all about decentralizing knowledge where people just get it's almost like other Koreans they just kind of eat kimchi and stretch you know I just think if Americans especially just lived a healthier lifestyles they wouldn't have to deal with this beast as much you know well yeah that could make all the difference but you know it's uh it's hard because if you go to the supermarket you know they basically only make money on the bad stuff yeah the stuff around the edge of the supermarket you know the meat and produce say they don't make much money it's all the processed food in the middle right that gets all the profits and they know how to direct you there right and and you know it's like you get addicted to the sugar and stuff like that and people just you know they expect that when they're sick someone else's heel so they don't think that oh I should take responsibility yeah like this is you know it's like the law of cause and effect I always think about the seven hermetic principles they apply so much to health and cause an effect you know when you're eating processed food and sugar and diet soft drinks and you know drinking beer and smoking Marlboros like of course that's gonna have an effect on your body it's gonna thank you sick you know it's like we all know that on some level right but then we go to the hospital and it's like the doctor maybe knows that too but they feel like oh well I'll be like insulting them if I tell them that you know but it's like but that's the truth like that's the only thing that you can really change to get healthy I mean what about this bariatric surgery what a crazy crazy thing let's make your stomach so small that you can't eat normally so you lose weight instead of just changing what you eat yeah I knew a guy did that and then he died it's uh it's not very effective it's uh no and the commercials for the drugs are clown world to where it's just like do you do you have tingling in your hands and then the side effects are like your dick may fall off you may contemplate suicide you'll jump out of a building you're you're you you'll feel like you're on fire all the time and I laughed out loud today listening to one of those ads because I rarely even hear ads because I don't watch TV but I was listening to a YouTube video and one of these ads came up and I just don't see how people still fall for it I think it's getting less and less people are falling for it but this do you have any final thoughts on on this I'm this big push for this new vaccine and Bill Gates and Colvin and how people can survive it because I don't want to put people in a bummer feeling like if you try to heal yourself they're gonna get you at the heart attack on you know it's like no no no we get me not you don't so don't worry about it as long as you don't patent stuff I think you'll be fine just don't patent anything the patents is how they that's when the heart attack gun gets loaded well you know listen there there are definitely things you could do to mitigate the toxicity from a vaccine but I don't think that's the approach that I recommend yeah the approach I recommend is to not accept a vaccine you know I mean you have a right to determine what put is put in your body and I know that there might be people who by force infringe upon that right and if someone holds you down and gives you a shot and there's nothing you could do I mean I'll definitely give you the recipe that can help but but I think you know if if enough of us say no then they're they're not gonna be able to overcome that because there's only a few of them oh yeah I oddly understand the PlayBook of being a global tyrant I don't know why but there's nothing so few of them that you have to do it to yourself it's all it has to do with shame and manipulation I think there's like three there's like nobody doing it so many people do it to themselves to self-soothe because they're scared like these masks people want to wear the mask I'm starting to realize that that it's not the government doing it to people it's people for whatever reason are because they'll throw these these things out all the time and if people don't bite it just falls apart and now people are biting even though no one can name one person who died of something that doesn't really exist oh do you think vaccines have gotten more dangerous or less dangerous since the cow plus days and DDT and polio no because I feel like it used to be worse oddly with DDT and shit you know with the polio vaccine well you know they didn't put I don't think they put DDT in a vaccine but DDT was one of the factors that caused polio exactly um yeah no but there I mean you're right there was like when they made the diphtheria toxin it's not wasn't exactly the same it was like passive because they would actually give the vaccine to horses and then they would give horse serum to humans and that caused like serum sickness which was pretty bad it's like having like a transfusion reaction and so we don't see that particular thing anymore but I would say you know like with the increasing amount of injections that are required and that children are getting that's what is responsible for the increased disease and and death I mean vaccines kill people too like it's pretty it's pretty well known now that there like that shaken baby syndrome or a sudden infant death syndrome that's really sudden death from vaccines yeah totally people I never understood that it's like sudden infant death syndrome it's like how like was it the vaccine and it's it's great it really is up to us to protect ourselves cuz they won't tell us for obvious reasons you know yeah well they so like the CDC actually you know cuz there's this voluntary reporting system for vaccine adverse events is called bears v AER - s yeah and you can actually go in there and like pull up all the data if you if you want but it to have it in like a spreadsheet form they like carbureted comma separated values so it's not user friendly but it's a voluntary system so the CDC paid some research you no hello my going alright sorry about that guys one second so sorry about that my friend my computer died I was I was riding it to the edge I came inside to play oh no way yeah oh you had no plug outside no no I didn't realize how much gravy uh and I was I didn't want to interrupt it I was it was like five four because I was like this is too good I can't go inside and I so I just plugged it in so anyway finish your thought I'm sorry brother oh yeah what the heck was I talking about you were talking about the CDC and uh yeah yeah yeah all right so they so so they they pay these guys at Harvard or say you know give them a grant and they say we want you to like you know measure the adverse events from vaccines and see you know does it match up with what they're reporting it bears and I think they figured it would show that oh yeah they're capturing everything and so they like start looking at this throughout the high the entire Harvard Health System which is pretty big like several hospitals lots of clinics it's a big business yeah and what they found is a tons of adverse effects events from vaccines and they they said basically that the official reporting the Bears system only represents about one percent of the total vaccine injuries based on their research and so they told the CDC this and the CDC says okay stop what you're doing don't publish and just forget about it yeah fine just like a newspaper article or you know an interview where they report this so is there is there an end to this or what do you see coming down the pipe because could this thing just start crumbling from general knowledge and people saying no cuz I feel like people used to be a lot more trusting with medicine and they are now or is it's just a machine that's gonna keep on cranking like what do you what do you seek out because people despise Bill Gates now you know if you look on his Instagram they don't have enough heart attack gun bullets for everybody there's like fifty thousand comments that are like he'll never touch me you stay away from my children you know it's and I never knew that as a kid as a kid my mom didn't vaccinate me um because she was woke to some stuff but uh everyone I knew got vaccinated no one even thought about it you know yeah I was vaccinated um I got one snow shot so I'm in the club I have been poisoned oh you got one vaccine or something else I got one flu shot cuz out my life in it my wife was pregnant and I I didn't ever have a hatred for anti-vaxxers I was just like everyone needs to relax it's fine and so they were like oh this will lower your chance of getting the flu this year and you don't give it to your wife but I was that great and that's the only time I've ever been vaccinated but I uh you know immediately after I just developed breasts and became homosexual so I don't but so uh you know well you know it can't cause infertility right that's not Bill Gates the strategy right is that what he's is that his point well he said he made a comment at some talk and this is before the you know the pandemic started but it was basically through vaccine policy and family planning his goal was to reduce the world's population about 15 percent right away that's like a billion people yeah it's just a sick little puppy I yeah I mean I I definitely have a crazy emotions about the fact that my kids got vaccinated but I think it'll be okay you know they're really good kids you know yeah yeah I have the same dilemma because I vaccinated them up to a point you know before I I realized this and looked at it because you are medical school they tell you that it's like the miracle of the 20th century exactly I was I turned down a miracle I I thought I I remember being you know people Chris Rocky's dogs joke there's no money in the cure and it's like and everyone's like the last disease they cared was polio and now looking back I'm like they created all the diseases ya know the polio went away like several years before the Sabin vaccine because you know there was it was like a year before the Salk vaccine they were racing to make a vaccine because they they needed the opportunity to you know get in there and say that they figured it out and the Salk vaccine was rushed and then it basically costs a bunch of bad you know I don't remember exactly what it caused but it made people really sick and they just pulled it and then it took two more years before it's safe and vaccine was available and in that by that time there was there were no cases of polio because they stopped using lead arsonate and DDT and that's that's what really caused the the paralysis every summer you know it was in the summer because that's when they sprayed the crops with it exactly you know I mean it everything was there to match it up but they you know at the time nobody considered it as a possibility yeah and same with Gulf War Syndrome where it was all the anthrax vaccine yeah I I'm convinced that Spanish flu had something to do with the first world war one vaccine because everybody that got it were like young men oh no yeah I mean that's an excellent point because all the soldiers returning from the war we're all you know vaccinated to go back into the country and a lot of the many of them got sick there's some there's some good evidence on that you know David Parker don't Lester talk about that in their book so that's really good stuff but you know to answer what you were saying before like I I think there have been an acceleration of people opening up to the truth you know waking up and it's that it seems to be even more in the last couple of weeks but I think that's why you know the elite or whatever you want to call them accelerated their plan you know they had to they were getting desperate because that they weren't gonna be able to do it and they're you know they're trying really hard I mean this is a you know there's a lot of clever aspects to this whole current you know staged pandemic that that are really you know manipulating people I can and I don't think you've been there's gonna be like I know some countries like Poland and at one of the European countries like past laws providing for mandatory vaccines in this kind of a situation but you know I think they're gonna make it voluntary at first because their people are gonna be begging for it almost because they're gonna be you know tired of the lockdowns and stuff where they're gonna say if you take the vaccine you won't have to stay at home you know you'll be allowed out and unvaccinated people have to stay home or they'll use something like that to make it you know coerced but still voluntary technically and then maybe later down the road they'll make it mandatory and and they've got this you know the plan is that they want you know us to be have some kind of biometric monitoring yeah that in like that invisible ink tattoo which is the Bill Gates technology or just like a smartphone app and there's some places already doing this like in Korea and Taiwan they they're piloting these programs where you know it's like tracks you and if you go through the neighborhood where there are people with reported cases of kovat then you know you get a red light on your app and you can't go into your office building at work or you can't access public transportation you know because you'd get people sick from an imaginary illness yeah that's why I see it's just like two roads are emerging you know because one of our slogans that we keep saying is they can try you know it's like well they want to it's like they can try because it does feel desperate and rushed I think the New World Order is actually falling completely apart the kissinger plans of the world are is it an absolute disaster and it doesn't functionally work so i think they're really really pushing nonsense at this point and a good wizard spell doesn't wake up this many people like 9/11 i was beaten on the ward drum like everybody else and the amount of the amount of people that did saw that as a live was so small and now it's way bigger and i think that they could get to a point where they have their chips in their ink in their patent six oh six oh six LARP live-action role-playing nonsense but I think that that world will just keep getting smaller like if you want to ride on a subway for free or whatever they're not going to be able to keep people in their house they just aren't it just isn't gonna happen and people you know every time the tyrant pushes like goes all in like this the blowback is insanity you know people are just like not having it you know that like Bill Gates just made about 50 million people anti-vaxxers I definitely hope that's true and you know people are like there's been protests this weekend all over the place yeah what do you see with your friends and former colleagues and stuff like that how do they treat you well you know it's interesting it's very polarized because like says some former colleagues like I was good friends with it like now totally written me off and you know told me off you know on Facebook or whatever because because you know I mean if they if they listen to what I say and they know they know I'm a smart guy so they know I did my research and that there's gonna be something compelling and if they risk looking at that and then realize that it's true then they have to turn their whole life upside down you know and they just are not ready to do that at this moment in time so they have to basically cut ties to avoid that conflict so I understand that and you know I accept it and I've gotten a whole bunch of you know new friends as a result so like in my community like I live in a ultra progressive liberal kind of University neighborhood and so most of my neighbors even before anything was recommended or mandated they're like voluntarily staying at home or won't let their kids touch my kids or is to come and go near my kids so you know it's been really tough on my kids they're been lonely I know I mean at least they have each other we did get one playdate this week finally and there's one other kid that that is a approved for a playdate so but but on the other hand like there are some people that I was sort of work was acquaintances with and wasn't sure that they were really hoping to the full truth but like I knew in some areas they were open to things and now since this has happened and especially like after they saw some of my interviews and whatnot they're now totally like open to everything like bit waking up fully and so we've been having these like twice a week like clandestine and get-togethers and you know it started off with five of us and then there was eight of us and now I think on Tuesday there's gonna be like ten or eleven dude that's the blowback it's like that's how you make strong communities as you persecute them you know like the the whole you can't come in our store without a mask I mean that's that's the myth of the antebellum South black man you know it's like we don't want your kind here it's like if you if you're logically consistent and you don't hate yourself and want to hide your face in shame you're the new you know minority group and what people don't realize is minority groups can develop really strong awesome communities and in fact it's probably one of the things that makes some of them thrive because there's a there's an opposition where it's like well we're not those guys so then there's more draw at a community more draw to big families more drawn to survival and I I see it as awesome because even some of my friends at some of these alphabet agencies you know they've never gotten the order for the heart attack gun but they're even like what is this you know some of them have told their superiors were they're like I'll never force a vaccine on somebody because a lot of people have had friends who have had kids die from that stuff yeah so it's unlike Cova 19 who the only person anyone knows is a 90 year old cancer patient it's like it's like vaccines have damaged so many children there's been so much injustice that people aren't gonna play ball anymore there's too many yah there's too many mama bears ready to pounce you know well I gotta say you look like so right about that and it's it's the parents of the kids who have been injured and maimed and killed by these vaccines that are really responsible for so much of this awakening into the medical fascism and I'll tell you that the the parents of these kids are some of the most knowledgeable people about health like you know when I talk to them like I there's nothing I can mention practic that they already don't know something about yeah you know I mean it's it's impressive and you know I think that's that's the way it should be when something happens to your child you know you need that's your top priority and you're gonna put all your effort into that right and that's one silver lining about this current lockdown situation and maybe it's helping people actually see the trick a little bit better because they're around their kids now they have to live with them right yeah yeah and I've heard some people at work talk about like they're like you know I never considered this but I actually might do home schooling even after the schools reopened Zak you know I mean even my ex-wife said something like this and you know I was hoping because I really want to homeschool the kids and I'm loving having the poem you know I wish I wasn't so busy now but but seriously it's you know it's the way family should be like you shouldn't have strangers raising your kids a key dude that did my theory I didn't get a degree in sight in psychology or anything but I'm real knowledgeable in it because of my history of being a stand-up comedian and I think that what it is is people are wearing masks because of their shame because of what the compliance to it is this this real real fear of pedophilia I think has to do with public school it has to do with not having a connection with your kids it's almost like satanic panic in the 80s when so many of these moms were first leaving their children to work and they they had this feeling like something is horribly wrong like why are my children gone who's gonna touch my children you know and and it's like that now with so many of these panics because it's like that's why I always tell people like what are you doing in your life like why are you feeling this way why are you panic why are you depressed like what's your contribution like what's your because I think that's what's causing the masks is they're wearing the masks and they want the poison because of what they've done like that the responsibilities that they've given up like everybody should know out like alchemical medicine everyone should know their rights everyone should know how the law works how the water system works like what's going in their body and and people have been on this autopilot and so when these things come in they're like cover your face you know fear and and I really believe that is because people have given up there their sovereignty the autonomy their freedom and now they're waking up to it because the Beast is slow it's very slow moving it's very it's David and Goliath you know it's very if you have an accurate sling you know you can pop that bastard in the face and you can't really react very quickly you know yeah well that's what's made it so hard for people to see for so long and now that it's accelerating you know it's much more transparent and you know you got some really good points about the masks because there is a big shame component you know I mean even as a psychiatrist if I see someone with some kind of hairstyle where they're covering their face or they're wearing big dark glasses right it's like you know that shame is a part of that yes and and they're telling us that we are gonna make other people sick and it's like what does that be and that means like be ashamed of your own body yeah because your own body is diseased and it's gonna kill other people you know it's a it's a horrible horrible message and you know I mean and now I'm starting to feel sorry for people wearing masks like at first I was just really pissed off I wanted to want to just go yank him off people you know yeah of course I didn't but I did talk to a few people and you know James true was into this you know mask shaming for a while but but you know we realized that some people are just not capable of seeing things they just you know they're so entranced and that they can't snap out of it for whatever reason and it you know it's okay to have compassion for those people and you know they're gonna be the ones that are probably hurt the most because they're not standing up for themselves exactly yeah it's almost like seeing somebody in a wheelchair you know at this point I we call it pray or pelagic where it's like it's a spiritual injury you know because somebody is is so fearful and I and some people like wow so I just wear the mask to fit in I'm like would you sit in a wheelchair if someone told you to even if you could walk it's like that's the question like of course not yeah like don't you know this isn't just don't don't accept that narrative and it's all narratives and they can't do anything you know and so what are some final thoughts for people for how to deal with this we're all moving forward like you know what should people do just like how what's the best way to avoid the vaccine was the best way to you know just deal with this and what do you think is the the weaknesses of the Machine right now like what what do you see failing what do you see the bad guys doing right now that won't work well you know I mean you you you hit an early run when you said like they need our consent yeah right so I think the most important thing we can do is to not provide that consent and so that means you know whatever we're asked to do that's ridiculous don't just don't do it so like I don't follow any stay-at-home order I don't follow any mask recommendations or requirements like at work they told me that we're gonna have to like cuz Cuomo has an executive order that says you know people serving the public or whatever have to wear masks and you know I'm a psychiatrist I can I can I need to see someone's facial expression to relate to them I can't you know work if they're wearing a mask and so I told them I that I'm not gonna be wearing a mask and uh and I'm gonna you know in Tuesday I'm gonna put a sign on my door that's saying you're not welcome if you're wearing a mask because I can't work that way and I don't know what the consequences of that are gonna be for me but whatever they are I'm willing to accept them because I'm not gonna give up my freedom you know so if they asked me to take a test I'm not gonna take a test if they asked me to get a vaccine I'm not gonna do that now I am working on legal strategies to try and deal with that more effectively if vaccines become mandatory and I mean I want to have a strategy actually just for my kids for the regular school mandatory vaccines so there's a group that's affiliated with kal Washington who's a great legal mind it's called empower I and our movement dot-com and so people can definitely go to their website and see their their strategies based on a notice of liability and I think that's a very promising strategy it's been successful in other areas and but I'm not you know giving up there cuz I'm trying to figure out every possibility and every angle and so I'm working you know on that and I'm working on other things and you know we don't have to rush because there's not gonna be they don't have a vaccine yet so we have some time to prepare but I think in the meantime you know like take good care of yourself get out in the sunshine you know or even if it's gray and cloudy get outside right take your take your shoes and socks off and walk barefoot on the earth that's right get some exercise hug your loved ones you know physical touch is really important and don't give that up right now as much as possible and you know do your own thing like live your own life don't be afraid don't be intimidated don't be influenced by what other people do make your own decisions and you'll find that that's gonna serve you well and you're gonna feel empowered and autonomous you know like you're you're in charge of yourself which is the way it should be yeah cuz there's many many fates worse than anything they're threatening you with you know it's people would call people like us very brave and courageous and I'll uh I'll take the compliment but but it's it I couldn't I don't think people have really sat down and thought about what they're giving up if they don't do that what we're if someone can just make you wear a mask or injected with fetus cells like they can do anything to you at that point and so holding your ground is the smart move it's the safest thing you can do you know listen I would be you know more have more fear if I was just sitting around and passively you know hoping that it's all gonna end and then just be willing to cooperate with whatever I was asked I think I would be a much more fear you know so if you call this bravery or not you know it's like I'm just I'm not as afraid because you know I know like that whatever consequences I have for what I'm doing it's gonna be not nearly as bad as the consequence of just letting the system take over and make that our permanent way of living you know I'm not gonna I'd rather die than allow that to happen oh yeah and the is is when you get to that point you typically don't die you end up crushing like your name your bare name your doctor Crossman bear that's what everybody in the show it's it's so ironic it's almost like when you have the will to do it when you have the will to die in the hill god is like okay now you can leave the hill it's it's fascinating shit where it's like the people that I keep seeing dying you know another thing we keep talking about as you're your own hit man you know we can talk about the heart attack on and all that but in reality the thing that typically kills people is despair and unhealthy living and fear and depression and anxiety where they start self consuming with these appetites and these addictions until they're dead and the whole time they're looking in the bushes for Mossad or CIA or something but in reality it's their fear and they just start manifesting these diseases you know and and I I think that that's a real thing that people can take to heart where you know you're your worst enemy and your greatest advocate you know yeah well you know it's it's a it's another hermetic principle here right as above so below as without so within if you are looking at the system and buying everything and you know falling hook line and sinker you're gonna also apply that to your own internal situation right and you're just gonna not not even think about taking care of yourself right because it's like you're just supposed to be passive worker you go to work you come home you have entertainment you know and pizza and beer and soda and then you go back to work and that you know that's all the risk never stop to think what am i doing why am i doing it yeah yeah and we're still with so many cells you know James tries a great way of describing that they're like our army there's trillions of these cells it's waiting for orders and when you betray yourself they betray you back like if you treat your body and your soul like you're just a cog in a wheel for a guy who hates you they're just gonna quit their job you know and if you are like no I won't poison you I won't lie to you I will be strong for you your body empowers you you know it's like you have clear thoughts you your life improves it's it's it's a profound thing you know absolutely yeah I totally agree you're getting so much support in this check and you tell the people where they can find you and I give their thumbs up and support and you know yeah absolutely well you know you can definitely find me on YouTube I have a channel there the show is called medica mentum authentica and I've got my website up and running now it's andrew kaufman md com1 f1n and like md like medical doctor and you know i I definitely have I do some stuff on Facebook too so you can find me there and you know through my website people can contact me or request a consultation or interview or some people have actually contributing to research which has really been valuable and people doing some excellent work for me so I really you know in collaboration not forming so I really appreciate that kind of effort and I'm encouraging other people to you know put stuff out there too you know if some people have a good idea and they they describe it to me I'm like you know make a 10 minute video and I'll put it on my channel so cuz you know getting the information is the most important thing out there to people who want to learn what's really going on it's true and right now is 4500 people here on a Sunday evening listening about what medicine really is and I think and then another 50 hundred thousand oh listen I think that is you know I know I keep making fun of heart attack on but there's no there's no real you know back in the 70s they would have put someone like me in a padded room for for some of the things I say and no one would have even known and now I believe the Great Awakening is leading to the mask of shame and not the other way around so I think that we're looking at a really promising future if people just you know crush like dr. Crossman bear yeah I'm definitely looking at things that way myself you know you can you can look at the future in different ways but if you look at it with anticipation and excitement about the possibilities boy I'll tell you that's gonna serve you so much better and it'll energize you to to actually make that come about yeah when I was a kid at any minute Russia was gonna destroy us in a nuclear that's my whole life like I remember it was every day they're about to destroy you because I'm from a sweet girl New York near the nuclear power plant so they're always like oh this is you're about to be incinerated and so I know their game plan of trauma and then mold us into these shiny happy slaves and I just think that if you don't kick the Beast it doesn't even care like you can heal people I can make people laugh and they just keep trying to poison retards you know I'm saying yeah no it's true like I mean you know I like there's very few people in my area that would that would come to me because they're all you know using the the regular system and I like I work with a few people locally and they basically weren't really willing to you know really do everything you know it's like everything was inconvenient and you know that kind of attitude like oh maybe I'll just go back to the regular doctor and you know keep being sick and suffering but this community like these awakened people like that I've been working with it's incredible they they actually say no no no I want to do I want to do more like tell me what's the ultimate way to be healthy like I'll tweak anything you know and it's like that's that's the attitude that's gonna get you to be and you know at the top shape you know being able to do everything you want in life and and living a long healthy life so that's that's all people need to do well I know it's late on the East Coast and I'm sure you've been going pretty strong so it's been a pleasure man I love that we're buddies now yeah same

with you when you came at vaccines or viruses or Caronia being and faking gay but with that lab coat by god you're right exactly only thing I'd like to use letters Dmitry relax Owen did you see the podcast with Whitney and Tim Dylan what do you think about those I don't know I listened almost nothing anyway doing one tear autism can be a gift if it is a like like mine yeah yeah totally Jared so some of the biggest opposition's in life make people really strong I just don't like the people are poisoning haha little kids and and saying that it's medicine and I'm just one of those people like people be like how why would you you why would you speak up it's like do you not know what the alternative is what kind of man well I know what kind of man see I'm all over the place they don't have gravy ladles they don't have tribes they don't have families they're just useless it's like what kind of man finds out information like this and doesn't say anything like how that's that's why some of these people I think just marched to their death or they just live horrible lives because they haven't stood for anything they've just been scared and squirting my husband's granny from the hills of Arkansas I used to have him take turban time when he was a kid yes squirt boys vitamin K injection they have whacker calluses yes doctor crush man carries a large ladle yes alright thank you for introducing the doctor I was great yeah he went to MIT and Duke at weight probably just some quick that dude's facing intense ostracism to because he knows the other alternative he gets it I love my oh dude I was thinking about something too I loved my artistic sound with all my heart he's always happy and cheerful I'm putting smiles on other people's faces yeah it's great I just don't like that it's forced what was I just gonna say oh yeah yeah why no why no one of the best handbooks for dealing with the government this is so ironic this is how it operates the DARE program just substitute drugs for everything else remember the broken record just say no remember that whole program they did it about something retarded obviously but the entire playbook can be applied to everything in life I still remember the methods where it's just like just saying the broken record where you just keep saying now over and over again until they until they uh they leave you alone and all that rethink about the dare program and just apply it to the machine breaking news Joe Rogan has been diagnosed gay ferbots yes dant reverse psychology oh yeah totally reverse psych out dude there was up what are some of the ones that they said in there and the Dare programs anybody remember the Dare people in my neighborhood we're doers no but you do you remember honestly though do you remember any of the the Dare thing you always say the real N word is no right right but like there was like drugs are real good Sivan it no is one of my all-time favorite words weird stop drop and roll that was for fires oh by the way trying to get rid of IRA to stop disease would be like executing firefighters to stop fire and I know it's daunting I know it's daunting because it's so it's everywhere it appears no one understands it but people do understand it millions of us understand it marijuana is a gateway drug yeah which is also a thing where you got to remember that don't give them an inch not one inch they had us role playing selling to other kids in class right but they're only you can smoke a bunch of weed hugs not drugs drugs are really expensive just saying no how dare you program is a great sketch how do ya all right guys I'm gonna go if you'd like to support the stream P o box seven to seven Gig Harbor Washington 9335 subscribe to unauthorized TV on bare-bones merchandise comm bit shoot calm own benjamin comedy and again don't worry about this shit you know it's like people can start like when that when my computer died i saw in the chat people like these they got him they got dude no no like even the the hardtack gun talk III made it funny but watch out for white ghost stories and spook stories it's crippling and so gay you know it's like people will kill other people when they're about to be exposed and like put in prison or a rival cartel person they don't just kill dudes that suggest you eat minerals just trust me on this because it'll keep you in in fear and panic it's a control mechanism and I understand you know there's a lot of spook stories out there but like the the big pharma kills are typically other groups trying to get their turf it's right out of like hoodrat behavior or someone's ratting on them to go to do like time in prison other than that that there there's so much risk to that type of shit and so and they're so busy and so not interested in a group of people that want to heal themselves that you just don't worry about that shit does that make sense lots of homeopathic doctors have been killed okay mama jay baer so why don't you go and get super scared a lot of everyone have been killed I don't know what to tell you guys I saw that in the chat ooh is like 80 doctors have been murdered I that it's it's it's I was watching in the chat at the same time people saying they got to Owen the he brought that Bill Gates he said the name and dude it isn't real maybe they've killed some doctors maybe there was doctors that were encroaching on the turf I'm not saying that they were healing people but it was taking away margins the machine doesn't have a soul they look at profits and losses they don't look it like I really don't like this boy he makes me sad they don't even notice you and every time someone dies it isn't a fucking murder unless I die of a heart attack then obviously every murder Owen would be killed before any of us it's not going to happen no one's getting killed why no what would have killed me my alcoholic lifestyle where I used to go to sleep at 2:00 in the morning and then the next day 8:00 dude and I'd have to be up at 4:00 a.m. to do fucking morning radio and that dude it's all good the life is prison for the believer rollerblading accident more reason to practice what those doctors preach to honor them okay okay Dmitri Dmitri you can't even not type like a fucking paragraph every eight seconds how about you honor me by just not constantly writing shit in the chat that pisses people off I've become fond of you so I really don't want to just ban you but like how about you honor me Dmitri and forget about the the magical doctors for a second spells grow like a me the only time Amy's ever worried about me dying is working to death you know that amy tuned into me in love with me father of children light of her life in the home the only time she's ever showed any concern about me dying and I've like went to LA to do talks during this shit at the only time was when we're talking to someone who lost his dad from working too much and she looked at me like and I was like crush that's the only time she's ever like showed fear of my death because she's smart she isn't dumb like a lot of you fucking people how can I become a hard worker like BB um no I I work like a little too hard like if I dive are to him it's probably not the gun um no it's the gun it's it's Hillary it's Terp rough on your lip I don't know I'm not I'm just wearing a medical doctor outfit I'm not an actual doctor I'm
